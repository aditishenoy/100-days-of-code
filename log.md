# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with downloading datasets from Kaggle using command line and Kaggle API. Downloaded and unziped image files for project using python3. 

**Thoughts** Struggling with command line and getting the path right for the download. Started using GitHub and learnt about convolutional neural networks.

Starting work on https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection
Getting help for downloading datasets from Kaggle API from https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication


### Day 2: January 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out how to add python binaries to PATH and use kaggle API to download datasets! Worked on command line prompts for copying and moving files. Came across healthcare.ai, set up R studio for it. Can't wait to start contributing!

**Thoughts** Progress feels slow. But progress nevertheless. Have identified and set up system for two projects. Will start working on models from tomorrow.
