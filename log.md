# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with downloading datasets from Kaggle using command line and Kaggle API. Downloaded and unziped image files for project using python3. 

**Thoughts** Struggling with command line and getting the path right for the download. Started using GitHub and learnt about convolutional neural networks.

Starting work on https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection
Getting help for downloading datasets from Kaggle API from https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication


### Day 2: January 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out how to add python binaries to PATH and use kaggle API to download datasets! Worked on command line prompts for copying and moving files. Came across healthcare.ai, set up R studio for it. Can't wait to start contributing!

**Thoughts** Progress feels slow. But progress nevertheless. Have identified and set up system for two projects. Will start working on models from tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started building my first neural network today! Used pcam dataset and basic classification of TensorFlow. 

**Thoughts** Quite excited about exploring a completely new field! Never worked with TensorFlow or image classification before. The large dataset is making my laptop quite slow so that is kind of frustating. But overall, very productive session today!

Found this very useful cheatsheet for importing data using python - https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Cheat+Sheets/Importing_Data_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf


### Day 4: January 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tried finding out where and how to make changes to GitHub repo files.

**Thoughts** Didn't get much to work today, still trying to figure out how it works. 


### Day 5: January 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out where to make an edit in the repository!

**Thoughts** Wonder if there is a better way to search for an overview of how all the programs are connected through the models

### Day 6: January 13, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Explored tissue image dataset using openCV and converted into correct format to train model using Python. 

**Thoughts** Found that programming and running two files at the same time for testing if the code works on a smaller dataset would save time instead of testing on large dataset. 

### Day 7: January 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to train a basic neural network using the image dataset. Started using jupyter notebook.

**Thoughts** Facing some issues with speed of processing and some run time errors. 

### Day 8: January 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the same two projects I have been working on. Learned about Command Line Tools and Bash Scripting!

**Thoughts** This was a fun exercise today, Codecademy has a great interface for practice!

### Day 9: January 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Delved into bioinfomatics today. Started Rosalind problems - Bioinformatics Textbook Track

**Thoughts** Its going to take some time to brush up on basics!

### Day 10: January 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed PatternCount function today and started working on FrequentWords function. 

**Thoughts** Getting stuck with - "IndexError: list index out of range". Seems so simple but I'm not getting it. Hoepfully will work it out tomorrow!

### Day 11: January 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working with HTML for the first time today and developed a basic website design!

**Thoughts** So motivated by today's progress!!

### Day 12: January 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with HTML and CSS for building my personal website. 

**Thoughts** Stuck with choosing an appropriate font. Haha. 

### Day 13: January 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Got some input and changed my course and approach a bit to build personal website.  

**Thoughts** Great that I came across BootStrap CV templates. Would have taken so much more time had I started from scratch. 

### Day 14: January 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Back to Rosalind exercises. Getting stuck at one point, hoping a fresh look at it tomorrow would help!   

**Thoughts** Getting frustrated at this point.  

### Day 15: January 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Personal Website finally taking some shape. Should be done with it soon!   

**Thoughts** Very happy with progress today!

### Day 16: January 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed challenges in 1.2 Hidden Messages in the Replication Origin from Rosalind Bioinformatics Textbook Track and started with 1.3 today

**Thoughts** Fresh outlook towards the same problem made it easier to solve!

### Day 17: January 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed challenges in 1.3 Some Hidden Messages are More Surprising than Others from Rosalind Bioinformatics Textbook Track! 

**Thoughts** Sometimes these exercises are fun! 


### Day 18: January 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Dabbled a little bit in differnt projects today. 

**Thoughts** Didn't feel like today was particularly productive. Maybe not a good idea to keep this one hour of coding at the end of a long day. 

### Day 19: January 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with some WebDev. Trying to add a reference to a pdf on the desktop. 

**Thoughts** NEED to wind up with this website by tomorrow. Its a week since I started this project.

### Day 20: January 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Done with website! Woohoo!

**Thoughts** Feeling happy about having completed one project since I started this challenge.

### Day 21: January 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Final touches to website and making sure everything works. 

**Thoughts** Trying to figure out how to add pdf 

### Day 22: January 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: All final touches done!

**Thoughts** Nervous to publish. Hoping for some good feedback!

### Day 23: January 30, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Done with 3 Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold problems today!

**Thoughts** Improved my speed of solving these problems today. I remember starting the first problem 4 years ago and gave up. And today I solved it within 10 minutes. Happy to see how far I've come!
