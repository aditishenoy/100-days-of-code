The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 5, Wednesday, 2019].

## Log

### Day 1: June 5, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Modified and updated parts of my personal website. 

**Thoughts** Feels good to get back into the daily routine of coding for an hour everyday! 

**Link(s) to work** Haven't committed to Git yet. 

### Day 2: June 6
R2D02 - Made all the changes I wanted to on my website for now. Check it out here: https://aditishenoy.github.io/  Any feedback would be much appreciated :)

### Day 3: June 7
R2D03 - Brushed up on containers and singularity. Trying to build a singularity image for tensorflow-gpu 

-- Took Weekend off (Much Needed!)-- 

### Day 4: June 10
R2D04 - Think I am doing something wrong while building the singularity container. ðŸ¤” Finding a lot of inconsistencies with python packages I need in the container each time I log in. Anybody know of any good and easy-to-follow resources for using singularity? #100DaysOfCode

### Day 5: June 11
R2D05 - Made some progress with using an existing container. Worked on bringing all my packages and data in the right place today. #100DaysOfCode


### Day 1: July 13
R2D01 - Giving #100DaysOfCode another shot! ðŸ¤—
Set up my container with packages today. Starting with program to use PCA for dimensionality reduction.
