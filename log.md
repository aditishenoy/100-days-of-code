# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with downloading datasets from Kaggle using command line and Kaggle API. Downloaded and unziped image files for project using python3. 

**Thoughts** Struggling with command line and getting the path right for the download. Started using GitHub and learnt about convolutional neural networks.

Starting work on https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection
Getting help for downloading datasets from Kaggle API from https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication


### Day 2: January 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out how to add python binaries to PATH and use kaggle API to download datasets! Worked on command line prompts for copying and moving files. Came across healthcare.ai, set up R studio for it. Can't wait to start contributing!

**Thoughts** Progress feels slow. But progress nevertheless. Have identified and set up system for two projects. Will start working on models from tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started building my first neural network today! Used pcam dataset and basic classification of TensorFlow. 

**Thoughts** Quite excited about exploring a completely new field! Never worked with TensorFlow or image classification before. The large dataset is making my laptop quite slow so that is kind of frustating. But overall, very productive session today!

Found this very useful cheatsheet for importing data using python - https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Cheat+Sheets/Importing_Data_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf


### Day 4: January 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tried finding out where and how to make changes to GitHub repo files.

**Thoughts** Didn't get much to work today, still trying to figure out how it works.

### Day 5: January 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out where to make an edit in the repository!

**Thoughts** Wonder if there is a better way to search for an overview of how all the programs are connected through the models
