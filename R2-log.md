# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - Aditi Shenoy

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 5, Wednesday, 2019].

## Log

### Day 1: June 5, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Modified and updated parts of my personal website. 

**Thoughts** Feels good to get back into the daily routine of coding for an hour everyday! 

**Link(s) to work** Haven't committed to Git yet. 

### Day 2: June 6
R2D02 - Made all the changes I wanted to on my website for now. Check it out here: https://aditishenoy.github.io/  Any feedback would be much appreciated :)

### Day 3: June 7
R2D03 - Brushed up on containers and singularity. Trying to build a singularity image for tensorflow-gpu 

-- Took Weekend off (Much Needed!)-- 

### Day 4: June 10
R2D04 - Think I am doing something wrong while building the singularity container. ðŸ¤” Finding a lot of inconsistencies with python packages I need in the container each time I log in. Anybody know of any good and easy-to-follow resources for using singularity? #100DaysOfCode

### Day 5: June 11
R2D05 - Made some progress with using an existing container. Worked on bringing all my packages and data in the right place today. #100DaysOfCode


The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Re-started on [July 13, Saturday, 2019].

### Day 1: July 13
R2D01 - Giving #100DaysOfCode another shot! ðŸ¤—
Set up my container with packages today. Starting with program to use PCA for dimensionality reduction.

### Day 2: July 14
R2D02 - Finally figured out how to open an image from the terminal using a remote server. Yes, sounds simple but I'm proud of myself #100DaysOfCode 

### Day 3: July 15
R2D03 - Explored the dataset and sorted features/targets. Finally understood what kernels on kaggle are! ðŸ™ˆ Started my analysis on my first notebook there today! THERE'S SO MUCH TO LEARN I LOVE THIS #100DaysOfCode

### Day 4: July 16
R2D04 - Worked through some concepts in DL today. Will hopefully get to implement them successfully during tomorrow's session! #100DaysOfCode 

### Day 5: July 17
R2D05 - Implemented Logistic Regression for binary and multi-class classification. Quick hack I came across today to add colour to vim:

1) Create file called ~/.vimrc
2) Run vi ~/.vimrc in the terminal
3) Type 'syntax on' and save 
4) Open vi normally ðŸŽ‰

### Day 6: July 18
R2D06 - Practiced some fundamentals on list and string manipulation using python today. Went over some basic data structures #100DaysOfCode 

### Day 7: July 19
R2D07 - Entered my first competition on Kaggle today! Just started getting familiar with kernels and began with some basic visualisation. Additionally learnt about oop in python and studied loss, cost function & gradient descent. Got a lot done today! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª #100DaysOfCode 

### Day 8: July 20
R2D08 - Worked with filling missing values in features in a new kaggle kernel today! #100DaysOfCode

### Day 9: July 21
R2D09 - Went back to some old projects and completed much needed documentation. Worked more with visualisation in my kernel and started using seaborn. Went over some common python DS interview questions #100DaysOfCode
