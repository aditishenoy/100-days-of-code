## Log

### Day 1: January 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with downloading datasets from Kaggle using command line and Kaggle API. Downloaded and unziped image files for project using python3. 

**Thoughts** Struggling with command line and getting the path right for the download. Started using GitHub and learnt about convolutional neural networks.
